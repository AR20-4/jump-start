# Ada Developers Academy Jump Start

This repository contains the materials presented during the [Ada Developers Academy](http://adadevelopersacademy.org) Jumpstart program. This program is intended for anyone who is interested in jumpstarting their journey into coding. These materials and concepts will provide an introduction into programming tools, concepts and processes to assist in getting to the first step in your programming journey.

## Instructions
To approach this material, you should first read the learning goals for a given lesson. Then click through the resources one by one, sequentially. Some will be notes and some will be assignments.

The things in the folders (assignments, notes) are all linked in the resources, so you donâ€™t need to click on those folders after as it will only contain things you already went through in "resources".

## Learning Goals

_Introduction to Social Justice_   
Ada is as much a social justice organization as it is a school where people learn to program. **Our core values at Ada are building and contributing to a supportive community; creating and advocating for inclusivity; and teaching and practicing lifelong learning, all within Tech.** Having a basic understanding of social justice is crucial to upholding these core values.

_Preparing to Code_  
As you prepare to learn to code, we have prepared a series of lessons to identify your learning style, learn the art of problem solving, and develop good workflow habits.

_Learning to Code_  
Once you have prepared to learn to code, we have prepared a series of lessons to intro the fundamentals of coding, including: setting up your environment, writing your first program, learning programming vocabulary, and learning to store and interact with data.
