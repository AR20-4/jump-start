##Glossary of Terms


**Privilege**:  A special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group of people.

**Oppression**:  Social oppression is the socially supported mistreatment and exploitation of a group of individuals. Oppression occurs when established laws, customs, and practices systemically reflect and produce inequities based on oneâ€™s membership in targeted social identity groups

**Ally**: Person of a dominant or privileged racial, gender, sexual or other identity who supports and seeks to further the causes of those who lack such privilege (such as people of color or LGBT people).

**Intersectionality**: the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage.

**Queer**: An umbrella term sometimes used by LGBTQA people to refer to the entire LGBT community. The inclusivity of this term can help build community without demanding that individuals choose and represent a specific identity.

**Transgender**: This term has many definitions. It is frequently used as an umbrella term to refer to all people who do not identify with their assigned gender at birth or the binary gender system. Some transgender people feel they exist not within one of the two standard gender categories, but rather somewhere between, beyond, or outside of those two genders. They may also use the term **non-binary**.

**Cisgender**: Types of gender identity where an individual's experience of their own gender matches the sex they were assigned at birth.

**Implicit Bias**: Unlike explicit bias (which reflects the attitudes or beliefs that one endorses at a conscious level), implicit bias is the bias in judgment and/or behavior that results from subtle cognitive processes (e.g., implicit attitudes and implicit stereotypes) that often operate at a level below conscious awareness and without intentional control.

**Microaggression**: everyday verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to target persons based solely upon their marginalized group membership.
