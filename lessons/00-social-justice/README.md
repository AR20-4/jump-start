# Introduction to Social Justice

In the attached materials, youâ€™ll be asked to read and think about issues of identity, privilege, oppression, and social justice. This may be new to you, or it may be a huge piece of your daily, lived experience. Our readings will focus primarily on race and gender, but should also give you a lens through which to understand a wide breadth of social justice and identity issues. Our goal here is to build some of the linguistic and conceptual skills that will start the work of having safe, productive, community-affirming conversations about systemic inequities.

## Learning Goals
- Build a framework for critical, informed conversations around diversity and inclusion.
- Develop a shared social justice vocabulary.
- Develop an increased understanding of the impact of privilege and oppression on our communities, our careers, and our identities.
- Move beyond thinking about individual, overt bigotry to thinking about larger systems of institutional oppression.

Lastly, we'll read three articles that highlight the importance of intersectionality in effectively addressing diversity in tech.

## Part II: Understanding Privilege and oppression
In this section, we'll first look at the concept of privilege and how it operates both individually and systemically. Second, we'll develop an understanding of it's counterpart - oppression - by tracing the historical roots of the contemporary disparities experienced by black Americans.
