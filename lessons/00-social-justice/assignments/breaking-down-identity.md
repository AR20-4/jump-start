# Assignment: Breaking Down Identity

Although many come to Ada because they identify with female community, none come here bearing only gender identity. We  carry with us all the different parts of ourselves, including race, sexuality, ethnicity, religion, and class, just to name a few. Some parts of ourselves may garner privilege, while others may be culturally marginalized.  We can use the term “intersectionality” to refer to this understanding of multiplicity.

Please answer the following reflection questions on a separate paper.

1. List as many of your own identity categories as you can: (e.g. race, class, gender, age, religion, education, family structure, etc)

2. Which part of your identity are you most aware of on a daily basis?

3. Which part of your identity are you least aware of on a daily basis?

4. Which part of your identity was the most emphasized growing up?

5. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most misunderstood?

6. Which part of your identity do you feel is the most difficult to discuss with those who identify differently?

7. Which part of your identity grants you the most privilege?

8. Which part of your identity feels the most marginalized?
