## Creating a Gist Directly in Atom
_This lesson is optional. It walks you through how to create a `gist` directly from `Atom`._

4. Click `install` on the package named `gist-it`
5. When it finishes installing, click `Settings` on the `gist-it` package
6. We recommend checking `New Gists default to private`, as well as `Open new Gist after create`

### Part 2

2. Login to Github
3. Type `gist` in the `Token Description` text box, and check the `gist` box and scroll down and click `Generate token`
4. Copy the generated token

### Part 3
1. Go back to Atom and paste in your token in the `OAuth token` box
2. Open up a file in Atom that you would like to create a gist of and press `cmd` + `option` + `g`, name your gist, and then click `Gist It`
